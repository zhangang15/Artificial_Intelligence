=======================
###Python, Minimax, Alpha-pruning, Bayes
______
1. In project Bayes Networks Neural Networks, and Policy Iteration, I write a program that does inference in a (non-polytree) Bayesian network using the Monte Carlo method.

2. In project Genetic Algorithms, I implement genetic algorithm, adding crossover, selection and mutation operators. I also implement a fitness function for the n-queens problem and evaluate the effectiveness of these operators and the difficulty of the corresponding problem. 

3. In project Naive Bayes Spam Classificaion, I implement a Naive Bayes classifier in Python that can distinguish between spam and non-spam, or "ham". Specifically, this program is able to train on a set of spam and a set of "ham." This training includes counting the frequency of each token in both spam and ham corpora. 

4. In project Reversi, I create an agent that plays the game Reversi (also known by the trademark Othello). Reversi is a two-person, full information game. Rules, and some basic strategy. 

5. In project Slotmachine, I use a simulation of slotmachnie. I have done a sufficient number of iterations to convince I have found good results.
